# Workstation Access

This document will walk you through the process of connecting to your workstation node. This server will be used for creating, testing and committing all of your cookbook changes.

## Prerequisites

You will need an interactive SSH client. All work in the guided trial will be done from inside the workstation.

## Log in to your workstation

Pretty straightforward! We'll ask that you provide public SSH keys for any users you'd like to have access, and we will add it to the workstation's authorized_keys.

Username: workstation

You will have access to the ChefDK and the Delivery CLI inside of this server.
